            <h3>WARNING: I suggest not booting physical hardware with this image, I never have and therefore you run the risk of something dodgy happening to your hardware.</h3>
            <p>The code can be found <a href="mos">here</a>. It is a valid Bazaar branch if you can get Apache to serve you the .bzr sub folder, it also comes with a bochs config file again if you can get apache to server you the .bochsrc file.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, mos.iso is a bootable medium with the OS on.</p>
