  But what is an Operating System : The Kernel


    The Kernel is the only part of a running system that can directly access
    the computers hardware


    It provides access to this hardware for user-space applications


    This access is controlled by the Kernel such that it is fair


    In MOS, the Kernel is split into discrete modules, each which wraps one
    piece of hardware, or provides one service


    Due to limit time in this presentation we will only look at a couple
    of these modules
