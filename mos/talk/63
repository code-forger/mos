                          The Flat vs List Interlude!

    By using single linked lists, and keeping a pointer to both ends, we
    can make all useful operations on these lists 0(1) time.

    Further more, we can use the order of the list as the schedulers order.

    This means that for the scheduler to choose the next process, It simply
    has to move the front process to the back!

    This makes the scheduler 0(1) time rather than 0(n) time!

    This also allowed the IO manager to reduce its time complexities
