                                   Conclusion

    Although I have only had time for a short demo, and a brief explanation
    of some of the technical aspects and difficulties of creating an OS I
    hope this has given you an idea of the project.


    If you have any questions then I am happy to answer them now?


    Else a short game of pong could be played?
