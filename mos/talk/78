                        The Hard Drive Driver : Caching

    This method is effective because is it very common to want to read or
    write sequential bytes.

    For example, saving a 1'000'000 byte photo would before take 512'000'000
    disk IO's.

    In the new system, it would require between 1'000'000 and 1'000'512
    disk IO's
