                          The Flat vs List Interlude!

    Originally, the scheduler stored all process information in one big table

    However, this lead to a terrible asymptotic time complexity : 0(n)

    'n' here isn't the number of running processes, its the number of run
     processes. That means it includes dead processes too.

     When creating this presentation I quickly checked, and my computer had
     ~18'000 dead processes and only 100 running ones!

     This means that the scheduler was hundreds of times slower than it
     could be
