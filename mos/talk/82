                        The Hard Drive Driver : Caching

    When a block is searched for in the cache, the search almost always
    returns 'the same block you wanted last time' this is for the same reason
    that the cache works well: we often read out of the same block sequentially

    To alleviate this problem, the search remembers which block it returned
    last time, and checks that block first.
