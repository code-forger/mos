                                 The Scheduler

    The schedulers job is to determine the order in which processes execute


    However it also has another more subtle job : To maintain the illusion
    that every process owns the entire computer


    This is achieved in MOS using a simple technique I call 'stack hopping'


    Stack Hopping is where a function changes the stack that it was called on
    to an entirely different one


    For this to work the both the source stack and the target stack need to
    be in a specific form, so lets see how that works first.
