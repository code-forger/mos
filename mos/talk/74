                        The Hard Drive Driver : Caching

    The concept of the caching in MOS is simple but very effective.

    When a block of the hard disk is read, the cache is first searched

    If the block is not already cached, the block is read into the cache from
    The disk

    The read requested then happens to this memory location


    For writes, the process is the same, except the cached block is marked
    as dirty
