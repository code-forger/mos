                          The Flat vs List Interlude!

    Originally, the scheduler stored all process information in one big table

    However, this lead to a terrible asymptotic time complexity : 0(n)

    'n' here isn't the number of running processes, its the number of run
     processes. That means it includes dead processes too.

     When creating this presentation I quickly checked, and my computer had
     ~18'000 dead processes and only 100 running ones!

     This means that the scheduler was hundreds of times slower than it
     could be

     The scheduler also wasn't the only module that used the process table

     The IO manager used it heavily for keeping track of which processes
     have IO and which are hidden for example

     We needed a fix:
                                                                         057/086
